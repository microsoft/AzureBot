# AzureBot UX Guidelines
This document should help you design or add new functions to AzureBot in a way that is consistent with other behaviors.


## Writing Guidelines
### Use a Conversational Tone
* Use [Active voice, not passive voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5icZ24Ys7M)
* Use "I", "We", "You" -- Talk to people, not at them
* Based on the tasks, expectations, and context you want to establish, write out all of the prompts and responses you want to send. 
* Center what you write around intent: what you want to accomplish, the actions you want people to take and what people may want from you.
* Write multiple versions of each message. This creates a diverse experience and helps you avoid repetition and interaction fatigue.

### Bot Best Practices
* Provide as much value to the user as you can in the conversation channel
* Participate in a productive conversation in a natural way with minimal complexity
* Utilize the interaction patterns of the messaging canvas and the mobile OS
* Have a clear POV on what scenarios the bot will handle brilliantly
