# AzureBot Sample
The AzureBot is a sample that showcases how the Microsoft Bot Framework and Cognitive services can be used to create intelligent bots. The sample was created to show how a bot can be used to improve the productivity of any developer, admin, or team working with Azure. If you would like to set it up yourself and contribute, follow our [Developer Set Up](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureBot/blob/gh-pages/docs/DeveloperSetup.md).

As of January 29, 2018 we no longer maintain or host this Bot.

The current implementation focuses on authenticating to the user's Azure subscription, selecting and switching subscriptions, starting and stopping RM-based virtual machines, and listing and starting Azure Automation runbooks.

## Developer Set Up

AzureBot is built with the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://docs.botframework.com/) and the [Microsoft Bot Builder C# SDK](http://docs.botframework.com/sdkreference/csharp/). It uses the [Azure Resource Manager Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager) and other Azure packages.

Follow our [Developer Set Up](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureBot/blob/gh-pages/docs/DeveloperSetup.md) guide to get started.

## UX Guidelines

If creating new commands, our [UX Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureBot/blob/gh-pages/docs/UX.Guidelines.md) are helpful for the conversational tone and best practices.
